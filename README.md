# WARNING
DO NOT USE PORTAINER, it is known to not work and typcally breaks things... From the various discussions I've seen in the Arr communities and Linuxserver.io, they tend to trend on saying to avoid it... If your using portainer and this is not functioning as expected, that is likely your problem.... (Example: https://github.com/RandomNinjaAtk/arr-scripts/discussions/57)

# Support Info
Scripts are provided as-is... Generally, if a script works one time, it will work everytime, that is the nature of scripts... So if you're experiencing an issue that has not been previously reported and is more likely a technical problem of some sort, it is more than likely caused by user error...
